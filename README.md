# Bobs Burgers App

#Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my SPA about the characters of one of my favorites shows: Bob's Burgers. 
I made this project so I could learn MongoDB to connect the database to the backend, that's why it's a small project.
It's a fullstack development, that includes: 
-React 
-Redux 
-CSS 
-Bootstrap 
for the frontend; 
-Node.js 
-Express 
for the backend; 
and 
-MongoDB 
-Mongoose 
-MongoAtlas 
for the database. I connected it to an external API so I can show the characters. It contains a searchbar and the detail of the first 40 characters of said API
Here's the deploy version: https://bobsburgers-app.vercel.app/

Hope you like it ðŸ˜Š
